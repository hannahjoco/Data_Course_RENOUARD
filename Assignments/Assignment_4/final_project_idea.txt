\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my project, I would like to use some data I am anticipating from one of my research projects this semester. I have performed DNA extraction on some water samples from Huancavelica, Peru and am planning to send them for 16S sequencing. I should end up with some paired-end FASTQ files and information about read counts per sample. I will need to process the reads for filtering, denoising, and merging but then will use the cleaned up data for alpha and beta analysis. The differences can be visualized using boxplots for Shannon diversity and PCoA using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.}
